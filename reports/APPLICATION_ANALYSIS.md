## 💡 Core Business Philosophy

**"Booking Time, Not Lessons"** - The application treats teacher time as the primary commodity. Students reserve and pay for time slots regardless of attendance, emphasizing the value of the teacher's scheduled availability.

---

## 🎯 Major Functionalities

### **1. Complete Internal Scheduling System**

- **Custom-built replacement for Calendly**

- Dynamic pricing per duration
- Timezone-aware scheduling (UTC storage, local display)
- Advance booking limits (1-90 days)
- Blocked time management for vacations
- Recurring weekly lesson support

**Implementation Reasoning**: Built internally to avoid third-party dependencies, provide complete control over booking rules, and integrate seamlessly with invoicing.

### **2. Role-Based User System**

- **Three roles**: Student, Teacher, Admin
- **Teacher Features**: Full business management capabilities
- **Student Features**: Booking, viewing lessons, accessing materials
- **Admin Features**: System oversight, user management, background jobs
