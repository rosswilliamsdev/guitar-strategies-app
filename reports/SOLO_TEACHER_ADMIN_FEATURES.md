# Solo Teacher Administrative Access Solution

## Executive Summary

The Guitar Strategies app currently uses a single-role architecture where each user account has one role (Student, Teacher, or Admin). For solo teachers who need administrative capabilities, the simplest solution is to grant them admin access. However, the current system ties one email to one user account with a single role. This report proposes solutions to enable solo teachers to have both teacher and admin capabilities.

## Proposed Solutions for Dual Role Access

### Option 1: Composite Role (RECOMMENDED)

**Implementation: Easiest**

Add a new role `TEACHER_ADMIN` that combines both permissions:

```prisma
enum Role {
  STUDENT
  TEACHER
  ADMIN
  TEACHER_ADMIN  // New composite role
}
```

**Pros:**

- Minimal code changes required
- Single account per email maintained
- Easy to implement immediately
- No breaking changes to existing auth

**Cons:**

- Need to update role checks throughout the app
- Less flexible for future multi-role scenarios

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Add `TEACHER_ADMIN` to Role enum
2. Update middleware to treat `TEACHER_ADMIN` as having both teacher and admin access
3. Update UI components to show appropriate features for `TEACHER_ADMIN`
4. Set new solo teacher signups to `TEACHER_ADMIN` by default

### Option 2: Role Array

**Implementation: Moderate**

Change the user model to support multiple roles:

```prisma
model User {
  id    String @id @default(cuid())
  email String @unique
  roles Role[] // Changed from single role to array
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

**Pros:**

- Most flexible solution
- Future-proof for complex permission scenarios
- Clean separation of concerns

**Cons:**

- Requires database migration
- Need to update all role checks
- More complex authorization logic

### Option 3: Auto-Admin for Solo Teachers

**Implementation: Simple**

Automatically grant admin role to the first teacher in the system:

```typescript
// During teacher registration
const teacherCount = await prisma.user.count({
  where: { role: "TEACHER" },
});

const role = teacherCount === 0 ? "ADMIN" : "TEACHER";
```

**Pros:**

- No schema changes needed
- Simple logic
- Works for true solo teachers

**Cons:**

- Teacher loses teacher-specific features
- Doesn't work if admin already exists
- Not suitable for multi-teacher future

### Option 4: Permissions System

**Implementation: Complex**

Implement a full permissions system separate from roles:

```prisma
model User {
  id          String @id
  email       String @unique
  role        Role
  permissions Permission[]
}

model Permission {
  id     String @id
  name   String // 'manage_students', 'view_analytics', etc.
  users  User[]
}
```

**Pros:**

- Most granular control
- Enterprise-ready solution
- Highly scalable

**Cons:**

- Significant refactoring required
- Overkill for current needs
- Complex to implement and maintain

## Database Schema Updates Required

```prisma
model StudentProfile {
  // Existing fields...

  // New fields for enhanced management
  status           StudentStatus @default(ACTIVE)
  statusReason     String?
  statusChangedAt  DateTime?
  archivedAt       DateTime?
  lastActiveAt     DateTime?

  // Communication preferences
  emailEnabled     Boolean @default(true)
  parentCopyEmails Boolean @default(false)
  preferredContact ContactMethod @default(EMAIL)

  // Access management
  lastPasswordReset DateTime?
  temporaryPassword Boolean @default(false)
  passwordExpiresAt DateTime?
}

enum StudentStatus {
  ACTIVE
  INACTIVE
  ON_BREAK
  GRADUATED
  ARCHIVED
}

enum ContactMethod {
  EMAIL
  PHONE
  PARENT
  NONE
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: Ensure teachers can only manage their own students
2. **Audit Logging**: Track all administrative actions for compliance
3. **Data Privacy**: Implement proper data retention and deletion policies
4. **Password Security**: Use secure temporary password generation
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protect bulk operations from abuse

## Migration Path for Existing Users

1. Set all existing students to `ACTIVE` status
2. Initialize communication preferences with current defaults
3. Create migration script for database schema updates
4. Provide documentation for new features
5. Optional: Create video tutorials for solo teachers

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: % of teachers using new admin features
- **Support Tickets**: Reduction in password reset requests
- **User Satisfaction**: Survey on management capabilities
- **Time Saved**: Reduction in administrative tasks
- **Data Quality**: Improvement in student data completeness

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Immediate Solution (Option 1 - Composite Role with Dashboard Toggle)

1. **Update Prisma Schema:**

```prisma
enum Role {
  STUDENT
  TEACHER
  ADMIN
  TEACHER_ADMIN  // New role
}
```

2. **Update Middleware:**

```typescript
// In middleware.ts
const hasTeacherAccess = (role: Role) =>
  role === "TEACHER" || role === "TEACHER_ADMIN" || role === "ADMIN";

const hasAdminAccess = (role: Role) =>
  role === "ADMIN" || role === "TEACHER_ADMIN";
```

3. **Update Registration Logic:**

```typescript
// For solo teacher signup
const isSoloTeacher = true; // Based on signup flow or system config
const role = isSoloTeacher ? "TEACHER_ADMIN" : "TEACHER";
```

4. **Dashboard Toggle Implementation:**

#### Visual Design

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Dashboard                                              │
│                                                         │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────┐                 │
│  │ 👨‍🏫 Teacher View  ⚡  Admin View 👨‍💼│  <- Toggle    │
│  └──────────────────────────────────┘                 │
│                                                         │
│  [Dashboard content changes based on selected view]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Component Implementation

```tsx
// app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx
export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);

  if (session.user.role === "TEACHER_ADMIN") {
    // Render dashboard with toggle component
    return <DualRoleDashboard user={session.user} />;
  }
  // ... existing role handling
}

// components/dashboard/dual-role-dashboard.tsx
("use client");

import { useState } from "react";
import { TeacherDashboard } from "./teacher-dashboard";
import { AdminDashboard } from "./admin-dashboard";

export function DualRoleDashboard({ user, teacherData, adminData }) {
  const [view, setView] = useState<"teacher" | "admin">("teacher");

  return (
    <div className="p-6">
      {/* Toggle Switch */}
      <div className="flex justify-center mb-6">
        <div className="bg-muted rounded-lg p-1 flex gap-1">
          <button
            onClick={() => setView("teacher")}
            className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-md transition-colors ${
              view === "teacher"
                ? "bg-background text-foreground shadow-sm"
                : "text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground"
            }`}
          >
            👨‍🏫 Teacher View
          </button>
          <button
            onClick={() => setView("admin")}
            className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-md transition-colors ${
              view === "admin"
                ? "bg-background text-foreground shadow-sm"
                : "text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground"
            }`}
          >
            👨‍💼 Admin View
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Conditional Dashboard Rendering */}
      {view === "teacher" ? (
        <TeacherDashboard {...teacherData} />
      ) : (
        <AdminDashboard {...adminData} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Navigation Updates

```typescript
// components/layout/dashboard-sidebar.tsx
function DashboardSidebar({ user }) {
  const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<"teacher" | "admin">("teacher");

  if (user.role === "TEACHER_ADMIN") {
    // Show navigation items based on current view mode
    const navItems = viewMode === "teacher" ? teacherNavItems : adminNavItems;

    return (
      <nav>
        {/* View mode persists across navigation */}
        <ViewModeContext.Provider value={{ viewMode, setViewMode }}>
          {navItems.map((item) => (
            <NavItem key={item.href} {...item} />
          ))}
        </ViewModeContext.Provider>
      </nav>
    );
  }
  // ... existing navigation logic
}
```

#### State Persistence

```typescript
// Store view preference in localStorage or session
useEffect(() => {
  const savedView = localStorage.getItem("dashboardView");
  if (savedView === "admin" || savedView === "teacher") {
    setView(savedView);
  }
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem("dashboardView", view);
}, [view]);
```

### Migration for Existing Solo Teachers

```sql
-- Identify solo teachers (only teacher in system)
UPDATE "User"
SET role = 'TEACHER_ADMIN'
WHERE role = 'TEACHER'
AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "User" WHERE role = 'TEACHER') = 1;
```

## Benefits of the Dashboard Toggle Approach

1. **Clean UX**: Single toggle switch for context switching
2. **Focused Interface**: Users see only relevant features for their current mode
3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No menu clutter from showing all features at once
4. **Immediate Implementation**: Can be deployed today with minimal changes
5. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing auth and role checks continue to work
6. **Single Account**: Maintains one email = one account principle
7. **Full Access**: Solo teachers get all capabilities in appropriate contexts
8. **Future Flexibility**: Can evolve to more complex permission system later

## User Experience Flow

### Solo Teacher Daily Workflow

1. **Morning**: Logs in, defaults to Teacher View

   - Sees today's lessons
   - Reviews student progress
   - Logs completed lessons

2. **Admin Tasks**: Clicks toggle to Admin View

   - Creates new student account
   - Deactivates inactive student
   - Views financial reports
   - Manages system settings

3. **Back to Teaching**: Toggles back to Teacher View
   - Returns to familiar teacher interface
   - Continues with lesson management

### Visual Indicators

- **Current Mode Badge**: Small indicator showing current view mode
- **Breadcrumbs**: Include view mode in navigation breadcrumbs
- **Color Coding**: Subtle color differences between modes (optional)
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + V` to toggle views quickly

## Conclusion

Instead of building parallel administrative features for teachers, granting them admin access through a composite `TEACHER_ADMIN` role is the most pragmatic solution. This approach:

- Eliminates the need for duplicate feature development
- Provides immediate access to all administrative capabilities
- Maintains system simplicity
- Can be implemented in hours, not weeks
- Preserves the ability to function as both teacher and admin

This solution recognizes that solo teachers ARE the administrators of their practice and should have full control over their system without artificial barriers.
