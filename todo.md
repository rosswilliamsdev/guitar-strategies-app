# Guitar Strategies App - Todo List

## Priority Issues for Next Session ðŸš¨

### High Priority Technical Debt
- [ ] **Remove Debug Logging**: Clean up extensive `console.log` statements added for debugging
- [ ] **Fix Unused Imports**: Remove `bookRecurringLessons` import from booking route (no longer used)
- [ ] **Schema Field Consistency**: Fix mismatch between `allows30Min/allows60Min` in schema vs `allow30Min/allow60Min` in validation logic

### Critical UX Issues  
- [ ] **Unify Recurring Lesson Systems**: Decide between RecurringSlot model vs individual recurring lessons - currently have both
- [ ] **Monthly Rate Billing Logic**: Address confusion between fixed "4 lessons/month" vs actual monthly occurrences (4-5 lessons)

### User Experience Gaps
- [ ] **Automatic Lesson Generation**: RecurringSlots only create 4 weeks initially - need automatic generation as time progresses
- [ ] **Booking Success Feedback**: Add clear confirmation of what was created after booking recurring lessons  
- [ ] **Timezone Consistency**: Fix remaining inconsistencies in timezone handling across booking/display

### Polish & Features
- [ ] **Better Loading States**: Add proper loading indicators during booking process
- [ ] **Email Notifications**: Add notifications when lessons are booked/cancelled
- [ ] **Calendar Integration**: Allow students to add lessons to personal calendars
